# 307 Redirect Fix Summary

## Problem
Your table creation endpoint was returning a 307 Temporary Redirect when making POST requests to `/api/v1/tables`. This was happening because:

1. **FastAPI automatic trailing slash redirection**: FastAPI was configured with `redirect_slashes=True` (default)
2. **Endpoint definition mismatch**: Endpoints were defined with `@router.post("/")` instead of `@router.post("")`
3. **URL structure**: The request to `/api/v1/tables` was being redirected to `/api/v1/tables/`

## Root Cause
The 307 redirect was occurring because:
- Your request: `POST /api/v1/tables` (no trailing slash)
- FastAPI redirect: `POST /api/v1/tables/` (with trailing slash)
- The redirect was changing from HTTPS to HTTP in the location header

## Solution Applied

### 1. Disabled Automatic Slash Redirection
**File**: `backend/app/main.py`
```python
# Changed from:
redirect_slashes=True

# To:
redirect_slashes=False
```

### 2. Fixed Endpoint Definitions
**Files**: All endpoint files in `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/`
```python
# Changed from:
@router.post("/", ...)
@router.get("/", ...)

# To:
@router.post("", ...)
@router.get("", ...)
```

### Files Modified:
- `backend/app/main.py`
- `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/table.py`
- `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/user.py`
- `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/venue.py`
- `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/workspace.py`
- `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/order.py`
- `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/permissions.py`
- `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/roles.py`

## Testing Results

### Before Fix:
```
POST /api/v1/tables → 307 Redirect → /api/v1/tables/
```

### After Fix (Expected):
```
POST /api/v1/tables → 401 Unauthorized (auth required) ✅
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the changes** to your Cloud Run service
2. **Test the endpoint** again - it should now return 401 (authentication required) instead of 307 redirect
3. **Verify with authentication** - provide proper JWT token to test table creation

## Deployment Command
```bash
cd backend && ./deploy.sh
```

## Test Command
```bash
# Test without auth (should return 401)
curl -X POST https://dino-backend-api-867506203789.us-central1.run.app/api/v1/tables \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"venue_id": "test", "table_number": 1, "capacity": 4}'

# Test with auth (should work)
curl -X POST https://dino-backend-api-867506203789.us-central1.run.app/api/v1/tables \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"venue_id": "test", "table_number": 1, "capacity": 4}'
```

## Why This Happened
FastAPI's default behavior is to automatically redirect URLs without trailing slashes to URLs with trailing slashes. When combined with endpoint definitions that use `"/"` as the path, this creates a redirect loop where:

1. Request comes to `/api/v1/tables`
2. FastAPI sees the endpoint is defined as `"/"`
3. FastAPI redirects to `/api/v1/tables/`
4. This causes a 307 Temporary Redirect

By using `""` (empty string) for the path and disabling automatic redirects, we ensure that both `/api/v1/tables` and `/api/v1/tables/` work correctly without redirects.
